2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
PDRC-153#1 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net COUNTER_1ST_DIGIT/E[0] is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin COUNTER_1ST_DIGIT/encode_result_reg[4]_i_2/O, cell COUNTER_1ST_DIGIT/encode_result_reg[4]_i_2. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#2 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net COUNTER_1ST_DIGIT/E[1] is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin COUNTER_1ST_DIGIT/encode_result_reg[5]_i_2/O, cell COUNTER_1ST_DIGIT/encode_result_reg[5]_i_2. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#3 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net COUNTER_1ST_DIGIT/E[2] is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin COUNTER_1ST_DIGIT/encode_result_reg[6]_i_2/O, cell COUNTER_1ST_DIGIT/encode_result_reg[6]_i_2. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#4 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net COUNTER_2ND_DIGIT/E[0] is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin COUNTER_2ND_DIGIT/encode_result_reg[4]_i_2__2/O, cell COUNTER_2ND_DIGIT/encode_result_reg[4]_i_2__2. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#5 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net COUNTER_2ND_DIGIT/E[1] is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin COUNTER_2ND_DIGIT/encode_result_reg[5]_i_2__0/O, cell COUNTER_2ND_DIGIT/encode_result_reg[5]_i_2__0. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#9 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net COUNTER_3RD_DIGIT/E[2] is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin COUNTER_3RD_DIGIT/encode_result_reg[6]_i_2__0/O, cell COUNTER_3RD_DIGIT/encode_result_reg[6]_i_2__0.
